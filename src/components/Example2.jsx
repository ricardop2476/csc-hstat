          Another thing that we are going to pretend is that a hacker is attacking the website. Oh no! 
          <br />
          The hacker is going to try to mess with the users of this website, by using his/her own JavaScript. 
          <br />
          As you can see, from the JavaScript that was used, a message could pop up on the innocent userâ€™s screen and cause harm later on.
